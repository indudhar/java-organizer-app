java-organizer-app
===========================

We have been involved in building web apps for a long time, 
and we constantly put together Spring, Hibernate and JQuery.  After each such adventure, we  
close the doors, give the code to the rightful owner and return empty handed.  All of these 
implementations were proprietary.  Every time we embarked on a new project, we felt as if we are 
doing the same thing all over again!  We strongly felt that we needed a base implementation that 
we can later modify and build upon.  We also need a sand box app for new recruits and team members
to play with.  The app needs to be maintained and constantly upgraded to keep up with the trends.

Keeping in mind the above requirements, we intend to build an organizer app with a simplified business case. 
The project is in its initial inception phase.

We are extremely open minded and welcome your comments and suggestions.
