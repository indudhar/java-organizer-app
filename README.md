java-organizer-app
===========================

I have been involved in building web apps for a long time, 
and we constantly put together Spring, Hibernate and JQuery.  After each such adventure, we had to 
close the doors, give the code to the rightful owner and return empty handed.  All of these 
implementations were proprietary.  Every time we embarked on a new project, we felt as if we are 
doing the same thing all over again!  I strongly feel that we needed a base implementation that 
we can later modify and build upon.  This implementation will be 
constantly maintained and will always be open.  While doing so, the app provides enough
features from implementation perspective to help new developers to use it as a learning tool.

We intend to build an organizer app with a simplified business case 
to come up with a nice and clean way to integrate these frameworks.  

The project is int its initial inception phase.

We are extremely open minded and welcome your comments and suggestions.
