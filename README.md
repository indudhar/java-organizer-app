java-organizer-app
===========================

We have been involved in building web apps for a long time, 
and we constantly put together Spring, Hibernate and JQuery.  After each such adventure, we had to 
close the doors, give the code to the rightful owner and return empty handed.  All of these 
implementations were proprietary.  Every time we embarked on a new project, we felt as if we are 
doing the same thing all over again!  We strongly felt that we needed a base implementation that 
we can later modify and build upon.  This base implementation need to be separately built and 
constantly maintained.  And we want keep it open.

We intend to build an organizer app with a simplified business case 
to come up with a nice and clean way to integrate these frameworks.  

We are extremely open minded and actively seek your comments and suggestions.
